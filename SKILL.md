# GEO SEO

Use this skill when the user asks for SEO, GEO, AI search visibility, ChatGPT/Perplexity/Gemini/Google AI Overviews readiness, citability, schema markup, robots.txt for AI crawlers, llms.txt, sitemap, canonical, hreflang, entity authority, or content improvements for AI answers.

This skill is adapted for Codex from the concepts in `zubair-trabzada/geo-seo-claude`, but uses Codex workflows instead of Claude slash commands.

## Operating Rules

- If the target is a local repo, inspect the code first. Identify framework, routing, metadata system, static assets, sitemap/robots generation, and deploy target.
- If the target is a public URL or the user asks for a live/current audit, browse the web or fetch the live site. SEO/GEO facts can be deployment-dependent.
- Respect robots.txt when crawling a public site. Keep crawl scope tight unless the user requests a broad audit.
- Do not spawn subagents unless the user explicitly asks for agents or parallel delegation.
- Prefer implementation when the user owns the repo and asks to improve/fix, not just advice.
- For OpenAI bot behavior, use current official OpenAI documentation if precise bot recommendations matter.
- When reporting findings, separate confirmed facts from inferences.

## Task Router

For a quick answer, run the relevant subset:

- **Quick audit:** homepage metadata, H1/H2 structure, robots.txt, sitemap, canonical, schema, Open Graph, page copy clarity, AI citability.
- **Full audit:** quick audit plus crawler access, key pages, content/entity signals, internal links, hreflang, performance hints, and prioritized roadmap.
- **Implementation:** modify metadata, schema JSON-LD, robots.txt, sitemap, llms.txt, content structure, copy, canonical/hreflang, and verification.
- **Report:** produce a concise markdown report with scores, risks, quick wins, and implementation backlog.

Read references only as needed:

- `references/audit-rubric.md`: scoring model and checklist.
- `references/implementation-patterns.md`: practical code changes and file patterns.
- `references/report-template.md`: output structure for audits/reports.

## Core Workflow

1. **Discover context**
   - Local: inspect `package.json`, framework config, routes, metadata helpers, `public/`, generated `dist/`, and existing SEO files.
   - Public: fetch homepage, `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`, `/llms.txt`, canonical URLs, and 3-10 representative pages.

2. **Classify the entity**
   - Personal brand, organization, local business, SaaS, e-commerce, publisher, agency/services, or hybrid.
   - Match recommendations to the entity. Personal sites usually need `Person`, `WebSite`, `ProfilePage`, `sameAs`, experience signals, and clear topical authority. Company/service sites usually need `Organization`, service pages, FAQ/HowTo where appropriate, and stronger conversion intent.

3. **Audit foundations**
   - Metadata: title, description, canonical, language, Open Graph/Twitter.
   - Indexability: robots, sitemap, canonical consistency, no accidental `noindex`.
   - International: hreflang alternates and `x-default` when multilingual.
   - Structured data: valid JSON-LD, correct entity type, `sameAs`, `knowsAbout`, contact and author details where appropriate.
   - Content: clear H1, logical headings, answer-first paragraphs, concrete proof, named entities, dates, credentials, and internal links.

4. **Audit GEO-specific signals**
   - AI crawler access: major search/AI crawlers are not accidentally blocked.
   - `llms.txt`: present when useful, concise, absolute URLs, organized by page type.
   - Citability: sections contain self-contained, fact-rich answer blocks that can be quoted by AI systems.
   - Entity authority: consistent name, role, company, social profiles, client/proof signals, and external references.
   - Platform readiness: content can answer comparison, definition, “who is”, “what does”, “how to”, and “best for” queries.

5. **Prioritize**
   - `P0`: prevents indexing/crawling or misidentifies the entity.
   - `P1`: blocks AI understanding/citation or weakens trust materially.
   - `P2`: improves coverage, snippets, internal linking, or content depth.
   - `P3`: nice-to-have refinements.

6. **Verify**
   - Run project checks (`lint`, `build`, tests) after code changes.
   - For live/local browser validation, verify rendered head tags and page content, not only source files.

## Recommended Outputs

For audits, lead with the highest-impact issues and concrete fixes. Avoid generic SEO filler.

For implementation, include changed files and verification commands. If you generate JSON-LD, include enough context to show where it belongs.

For content rewrite, produce copy that is understandable to humans first, then structured for AI extraction.
